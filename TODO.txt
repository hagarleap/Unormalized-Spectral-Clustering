21.3.23
todo on thursday:
  -start coding in C in spkmeans.c all of the functions: wam, ddg, gl, jacobi
  -choose the data structure to pass them (array of arrays)


**remember: printing "An Error Has Occurred" is the interface's responsibility***
**remember: for now we assume datamatrix memeory release is the wrapper functions responsibility in spkmeans.c***
**RELEASE MEMORY***
** REMEMBER ; *****






25.3.23
make sure all memory is freed


run all the testers for spkmeans.c - ask for someone who wrote tester



gcc -ansi -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic-errors spkmeans.c -o spkmeans -lm


how to do spk:
call jacobi
convert to dataframe
do heuristic if necessary
send k/heuristic and the DF to kmeans_pp

TODO 27.3.23
do the following functions:
kmeans_pp(U, k)
get_first_k_eigenvectors
print_matrix
spkmeans_capi.get_heuristic

figure out C module :)
finish project
sleep
do passover
say hi to your family and friends
