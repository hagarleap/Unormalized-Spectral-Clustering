todo on thursday:
  -start coding in C in spkmeans.c all of the functions: wam, ddg, gl, jacobi
  -choose the data structure to pass them (array of arrays)


**remember: printing "An Error Has Occurred" is the interface's responsibility***
**remember: for now we assume datamatrix memeory release is the wrapper functions responsibility in spkmeans.c***
**RELEASE MEMORY***
** REMEMBER ; *****

to finish the spkmeans.c:
create a main func to get command line arguments
  -create data matrix

within the wrapper function, create function that will print the correct output
  -release data matrix data

  **ask if we need eigenvalues separated by comma
